This file is basically a guide for developing the progression. 

### Philosophy of GameStages: 
GameStages will be like in SevTech, so the main will be stone_age, bronze_age, iron_age...etc Development will start with adding items to the stone_age stage first, then we can start adding items to the next stage.

### Players' progression
1. Gathering stones and sticks from the ground.

2. First tools/weapons in the 2x2 crafting grid.  
Making fire using the fire starter:

3. Woodworking:   
The wood working process will be like this:  
Stripping wood from bark, then depending on the resistance of the wood, chopping the wood to a small pieces (firewood, lumber). This will be in-game process.
