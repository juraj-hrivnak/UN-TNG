# Underdog: The Next Generation (in dev)

***

# Development
For developing Underdog, you must know [Git].  
And for installing/removing/updating mods [Pax].

## Syncing mods
To sync the mods with the ones that are written in the manifest.json, run `syncmods.bat` or `syncmods.sh` depending on your operating sistem.

## Syncing overrides
Everything that is not written in the manifest.json is an override. (For example configs, scripts, resources)
To copy the overrides you changed to the pax/modpack/overrides folder, run `sync_overrides.bat` or `sync_overrides.sh` depending on your operating sistem.



## Pax usage
Use pax using cmd or terminal.
To see how [Pax] works it's recommended to go check out its wiki: [here](https://github.com/froehlichA/pax/wiki)

### Locating pax folder
Locate the pax folder on your computer.
On both Windows and Linux you can use `cd` to do that.

#### Examples:
```cmd
Windows:
$ cd .\minecraft\pax

Linux:
$ cd ./minecraft/pax
```
